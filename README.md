This project combines the sequence labeling framework from Luo et al. (2020) and the incorporation of knowledge graph 
information from Weber et al. (2022) and Fang et al. (2024) to improve Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Relation Extraction (RE).
We reframe the sentence classification task into a joint Named Entity Recognition (NER) and RE problem.
